# My First React App 🚀

This is my first React project which includes a collection of small apps built using React and modern web development tools. All the apps are located in the `src` folder.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Counter App** – Simple counter with increment and decrement buttons.
- ⏰ **Clock App** – Displays current time and updates every second.
- 🖼️ **Image Gallery** – Fetches and displays random images using the Picsum API.
- 📰 **Fake Post Generator** – Fetches and displays posts using a placeholder API.

These projects helped me learn and apply React concepts like:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- Fetching data from external APIs
- Component-based architecture

## ⚛️ What is React?

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It helps developers create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React breaks UI into components, making it easier to manage, reuse, and test.
